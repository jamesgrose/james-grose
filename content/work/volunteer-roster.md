One of my first proper jobs was as the Sailing Administrator at Royal Brighton
Yacht club. I was responsible for running many of the club regattas, including
state and national.

One of the largest pain points that emerged from my time in this role was the
need to manage and communicate with many Volunteers at once. Especially over the
course of a an active regatta when safety boats and radio towers all need to
work in unison.

To address this need, I created [Volunteer Roster](https://volunteerroster.com).

Volunteer Roster is now used by many Yacht Club around Australia, and progress
on its 5th major update is underway.
