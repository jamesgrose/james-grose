One of my first jobs out of school was as the Sailing Administrator at Royal Brighton
Yacht club, where I was responsible for running many of the club regattas,
including state and national.

The largest pain points that emerged from my time in this role was the
need to manage and communicate with many Volunteers at once. Especially over the
course of an active regatta - where safety boats and radio towers all need to
work in unison.

To address this need, I took the initiative of creating a platform that I called
[Volunteer Roster](https://volunteerroster.com). A system for handling
registrations, documentation, and communication with a large number of
volunteers at once.

Volunteer Roster is now used by many Yacht Club around Australia, and progress
on its 5th major update is underway.
