I created BotBuster during my time at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io), when
[Roadshow Films](https://roadshow.com.au) proposed the use of Facebook Messenger
as a strategic opportunity in the face of a changing relationship between
consumers, cinema retailers and online video services.

# The solution

The solution was the production of a customer experience for Roadshow that lets
people and groups book movies via Facebook Messenger.

Buster is able to handle millions of interactions simultaneously, with the
ability to find any movie session at any cinema in Australia. People can invite
friends to the discussion and Buster will asynchronously facilitate the
conversation between them to arrive at a session everyone can attend.

In building BotBuster I leveraged the chat framework I
[developed for Qantas](/work/qantas-bot), and was responsible for the
end-to-end development, pipeline, and infrastructure of the solution.

# The results

- 20 average interactions each
- 30+ individual titles with a dedicated BotBuster campaign
- 50k+ individual conversations have been had increased conversion comparative to non-Messenger campaigns
