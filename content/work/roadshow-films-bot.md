# My role

Over the course of the BotBuster project, I was responsible for the complete
development pipeline and infrastructure of the solution. I leveraged the chat
framework I [developed for Qantas](/work/qantas-bot), and deployed it with the
same battle test hosting configuration.

I was involved directly with stakeholders at all stages of the project, from the
initial proposal to backlog development and presentations.

# The project

The project came about when [Roadshow Films](https://roadshow.com.au) proposed
the use of Facebook Messenger as a strategic opportunity. We responded with an
idea for a bot that lets people and groups book movies - all within Messenger.

Buster is able to handle millions of interactions simultaneously, with the
ability to find any movie session at any cinema in Australia. People can invite
friends to the discussion and Buster will asynchronously facilitate the
conversation between them to arrive at a session everyone can attend.

# The results
