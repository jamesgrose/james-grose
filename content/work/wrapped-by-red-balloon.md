# My role

My role on the project was as the sole developer and solutions architect -
responsible for all data, integrations, and frontend development.

I built the site in Shopify Plus, and worked directly with
[RedBalloon](https://www.redballoon.com.au/) in Sydney to define requirements
and develop the brand.

# The project

Our mission was to make thoughtful gifting easier, and our challenge was to
stand up a fully transactional ecommerce site in under 2 months - just in time
for Christmas shopping.

- $1m+ worth of product sold in first 4 months
