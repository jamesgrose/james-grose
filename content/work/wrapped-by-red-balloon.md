I created Wrapped at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io) as a joint venture with [RedBalloon](https://www.redballoon.com.au/).

Our mission was to celebrate people's unique relationships by making thoughtful gifting easier,
and our challenge was to stand up a fully transactional website in under 2 months - just in time for Christmas shopping.

My role on the project was as the sole developer and solutions architect -
responsible for all data, integrations, and frontend development.
