Working with [Specsavers](https://www.specsavers.com.au/),
[B.B.E](https://bbe.io) and I set out to develop a digital in store experience
which would give both customers and store staff a point of interest and
convergence.

# The solution

Research identified that the volume of product in store was often overwhelming.
To tackle a solution a touch screen app was designed to supplement a reduced
number of SKUs on shelf - minimising clutter, without losing the ability to
up-sell or cross sell.

Touch and gesture enabled, the touch screen allowed customers to search based on
face shape, brand, colour, and price range to see products from all angles.

My role on this project was to manage the data, hardware, and systems
integrations. I provisioned customised OSs to the touch screens that operated
without allowed for management and allowed for responsive touch gestures.

The devices could be deployed to any store where they would sync down changes to
both code and products, and then operate in a completely offline fashion -
Reporting tracking events when a connection is successfully reestablished.

# The results
- Successful pilot in concept stores
- Roll out across a number of pop-up stores
- 1000s of products sampled across a range of brands and price ranges
- Improving dwell time without impacting retail staff requirements
