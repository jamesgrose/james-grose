# My role

My primary role on Fliteboard was as the Solutions Architect.
After multiple client workshops it became clear that we had to develop a custom
solution to deliver on the unique requirements that Fliteboard, and designing
that system was my responsibility.

I lead the project from a technical perspective, and developed the
infrastructure, pipeline, and backend with multiple payment gateways and a
fully unit tested API. The solution was then deployed in the form of a
statically compiled frontend, and an autoscaling backend deployed to AWS.

# The project

Early in 2019, [Fliteboard](https://fliteboard.com) received a large round of
funding, and with millions in presales, there was not yet a framework to build
and deliver products at scale. My team at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io) was engaged to
develop an ecommerce solution that would fulfill on pre-sales, for a market
launch in 90 days.

From brief to market launch, the site was completely rebuilt and launched with
global shipping and online sales in 13 regions.

With a complex product structure comprised of 9 individual components from a
pool of 20+ components, which in turn are each constructed from 100+ units,
there were 672 individual SKUs for each possible product bundle.

To solve this, I designed and implemented a solution in which products could be
effectively tracked by their components, but purchased as a single configurable
product by the customer.

This reduction in inventory management overheard contributed to successfully
forecasting sales and reducing lead time on orders from 3 months to 6 weeks.

# The results

- On track to realise $17m in year 1 sales

- 426% increase in traffic
- 4901 assertions across 169 automated unit tests, covering all aspects of the API
- Reduction of server response time from 4-8 seconds, down to .0002 seconds, with automated and scalable hosting
