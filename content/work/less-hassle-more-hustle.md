# My role

Over the course of this project I worked with the client to specify the solution
and lead the development of this campaign landing page - deployed onto
Momentum's existing CMS.

The landing page was built in VueJS and used custom built SVGs to animate and
change the site as the user scrolled through.

# The project

A highly interactive and dynamic campaign landing page built for
[Momentum Energy](https://www.momentumenergy.com.au/) at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io)
to help differentiate brand and service in a homogenised market.

# The results

Not only did Momentum Energy break all-time monthly sales records (for
consecutive months) during a highly politicised time for Australian energy, we
achieved brand awareness of 47% and reduced call centre transfers by 50%.
