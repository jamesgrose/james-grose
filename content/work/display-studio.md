Display Studio was developed from my work with [Medibank](https://www.medibank.com.au)
during my time at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io). We needed a simple and lightweight
way to connect the audience to personalised and effective content on platform.

# The solution

Display Studio was created as its own standalone SaaS platform.

By monitoring how the user navigates the website, and hooking into data sources
such as Salesforce or Hubspot, Display Studio is able to auto-optimise and
prioritise the content that is going to result in the most likely click-through
to conversion. Providing a cost effective way to serve up content and ads in
real time that are a reflection of a customers behaviour.

This provided a cost effective way to serve up content and ads in real
time that are a reflection of our customers behaviour, nudging audiences towards
the next best action.

My role on the project was initially as the sole developer, and later as the
Tech Lead as the solution scaled to require more robust infrastructure and a
revamp of the management portal.

# The result

- Utilised by 4 clients
- +70 million tracked data points
