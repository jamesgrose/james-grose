# My role

Initially as the sole developer, and later as the Tech Lead - I built Display
Studio and lead it's development as we scaled it to a fully featured SaaS.

The project was built with Laravel as the backend, and had a custom tracking
script that injected display banners into sites and monitored usage. As demand
for the project grew, I optimised the hosting configuration and migrated to a
new database that could deal with the large demand.

# The project

Display Studio was born from my work with Medibank on other projects - we needed
a simple and lightweight way to connect the audience to personalised and
effective content on platform.

By monitoring how the user navigates the website, and hooking into data sources
such as Salesforce or Hubspot, Display Studio is able to auto-optimise and
prioritise the content that is going to result in the most likely click-through
to conversion. Providing a cost effective way to serve up content and ads in
real time that are a reflection of a customers behaviour.

This provided a cost effective way to serve up content and ads in real
time that are a reflection of our customers behaviour, nudging audiences towards
the next best action.
