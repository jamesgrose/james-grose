In 2020 and beyond, [Live Better](https://www.medibank.com.au/livebetter/) is
[Medibank's](https://www.medibank.com.au/) primary go-to-market proposition.
It's a project I've been working on at [B.B.E](https://bbe.io) since its humble
beginnings, and is now the unifying platform from which communications stems.

Over the course of this project I have been responsible for all hosting and
backend systems. I built the initial frontend - then lead it's continued
development.

# Health Brief

The road to Live Better starts with creation of a new content marketing site;
Medibank Health Brief. In partnership with Roy Morgan, Health Brief became an
expansive and trusted resource to support Australians in preventative and
restorative health.

Created in React, the site pulled content from WordPress over the API to deliver
a dynamic and responsive experience to all user.

# School of Better

In the same year as Health Brief, we also launched School of Better, a custom
built learning management system which provided people with in depth learning
experiences on psychology, nutrition and physical health.

# Live Better

In 2019 Live Better was launched, which combined Medibank's 3 disparate
marketing platforms into one. With everything now connected through Salesforce
and other technologies, it quickly became the backbone of marketing automation
for Medibank.

Continuing the headless API driven approach from Health Brief, Live Better was
built with VueJS in the frontend, Contentful powering the content management
system, and Laravel providing backend microservices and utilities.

- Target audience increased in traffic from 8% to 15%
- The site became responsible for 5% of online transaction revenue within 2 months since launch
- Increased mobile views by 15% and tablet views by 2%

# Continuous development

Every second person who joined Medibank had previously engaged with Live Better -
it had become an incredibly powerful product, so development continued in order
to refine the site and expand the proposition beyond its current properties.

Live Better became the platform for much of Medibank's work, with campaigns such
as Free + Active, Procedures Cost Estimator, People Like You, and Healthy Kids
being created on it.

With dramatic increases in demand, I migrated Live Better's hosting to its own
Kubernetes Cluster. This large autoscaling cluster now hosts all of the
microservices and campaigns related to Live Better.

# Live Better App

In parallel to the previous years of work on Live Better, a team at Medibank was
working on a loyalty program to help promote healthy behaviour, in the form of
the Live Better app.

We worked alongside this team to utilise the headless approach we developed, and
deliver content straight from the Live Better site into the Live Better App.
