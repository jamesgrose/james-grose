I created the [Qantas](https://www.qantas.com/au/en.html) Concierge Bot at
[B.B.E](https://bbe.io) as part of a strategy to utilise Facebook Messenger as a marketing channel.

Qantas wanted a way to utilise Facebook Messenger as a marketing channel, while also automating basic enquiries.

> We recognise that different people want to communicate with us in different ways. With over 15 million people on Facebook in Australia, growing our presence with the social networking service makes sense

# The solution

The Qantas Concierge Bot was built to provide a convenient and useful tool that
sits complementary to Qantas customer service agents. By using set keywords and
natural language, it helped consumers with basic queries, flight deals, and
introduced them to new destinations from Qantas Travel Insider content.

This being the early days of messenger bots; a custom framework was developed
that fully integrated the bot with Qantas' social customer service platform,
Lexer, and delivered on Qantas' bespoke needs in an environment where comms and
be critical and challenging.

My role on the project was as the sole developer and solutions architect -
responsible for all data, integrations, backend development, and infrastructure.
