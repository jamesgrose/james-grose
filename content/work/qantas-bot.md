# My role

As the sole developer and solutions architect - I was responsible for all data,
integrations, backend development, and infrastructure.

This being the early days of messenger bots; I developed a custom framework that
fully integrated the bot with Qantas' social customer service platform (Lexer).
This framework delivered on Qantas' bespoke needs in an environment where comms
can be critical and challenging.

In order to act as the gatekeeper to all communications that flow through
Facebook Messenger - the infrastructure I created was subject to rigorous
testing. Kill switches were built into the bot to deactivate it in emergency,
and significant load testing and penetration testing activities were undertaken.

# The project

The [Qantas](https://www.qantas.com/au/en.html) Concierge Bot was created as
part of a strategy to utilise Facebook Messenger as a marketing channel, while
also automating basic enquiries.

> We recognise that different people want to communicate with us in different ways. With over 15 million people on Facebook in Australia, growing our presence with the social networking service makes sense
<cite>&mdash; Kristin Carlos, Qantas Head of Digital and Entertainment</cite>

# The solution

The Qantas Concierge Bot was built to provide a convenient and useful tool that
sits complementary to Qantas customer service agents. By using set keywords and
natural language, it helped consumers with basic queries, flight deals, and
introduced them to new destinations from Qantas Travel Insider content.
